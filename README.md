# pluralsight-cross-platform-xamarin-pt1
Learn how to use Xamarin to leverage your skills in Microsoft Visual Studio and C# to build cross-platform apps that run on both Android and iOS. In the first part of this course series, we show you everything you need to get started using Xamarin's integration with Visual Studio to create cross-platform C# apps. We provide detailed coverage of Xamarin along with other tools you need, their setup, architecture, and the basics of their use. We introduce the basics of creating an Android and an iOS application, creating a simple user interface, and how to test and deploy the application to emulators, simulators, and real devices all using Xamarin's cross-platform developer tools. Finally, we introduce .NETs Portable Class Library and show how to create a single class library that runs across both Android and iOS devices.
